## 📋 Project Overview
"**H.E.V. Suit**" is a **smart IoT-based protective suit** designed to **safeguard workers** operating in **hazardous environments** such as construction sites, mines, and disaster zones. 
It continuously monitors **health conditions** and **environmental threats**, instantly alerting supervisors through a **cloud-connected mobile app**.

> **A revolutionary protective suit for all workers who risk their lives.**

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🧠 Monitor **body temperature**, **heart rate**, **humidity**, **falls**, and **injuries**.
- 🛠️ Detect hazardous conditions and trigger immediate alertsfoe the admins.
- 🔎 Enable **GPS-based tracking** for real-time worker location monitoring.
- 📲 Send **emergency notifications** via **Firebase Cloud Messaging**.
- 👷 Enhance worker safety and speed up emergency responses.

## 🛠️ Features
- 🌡️ Temperature & Humidity Monitoring
- ❤️ Heart Rate Sensing
- 🛑 Fall Detection System
- 🛁 GPS Location Tracking
- 🚨 Emergency Buzzer Alert
- 🩸 Bleeding and Bruise Detection (Experimental)
- ☁️ Cloud Database Integration (Firebase)
- 📱 Web Interface

## 🧹 Technologies Used
